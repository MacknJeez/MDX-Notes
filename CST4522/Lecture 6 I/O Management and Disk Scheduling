What are some of the main functions performed by the OS?
Process, Threads 


Input and Output operations.
How the OS does IO management. (any data exchange operation that happens between computing system and external env. 

Catgories of I/O Devices:
HUman Readable (users can interact with. eg. keyboards, printers, mouse)
Machine Readable (ones that comm data in a format that can be understood by the computing system without human input)
Comms Devices (enable transmission of data between computing systems or between computing systems and larger networks)


Differences in I/O Devices:
Data Rate 
Application (or Use Case)
Unit of Transfer (bytes or characters, larger blocks like disks) (keyboard/mouse are character oriented devices, disks are characterized as block oriented devices)
Error Conditions (how the conditions are handles or responded to)



Organization of the I/O Functions:

Programmed I/O:
  The process will send a request for I/O, usually for resource constrained or low speed devices

Interrupt Driven I/O:
  Similar to programmed I/O, but the CPU won't remain in a status checking cycle. The CPU will perform another task, once interrupt is sent then I/O operation happens.
