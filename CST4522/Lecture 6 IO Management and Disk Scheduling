What are some of the main functions performed by the OS?
Process, Threads 
Process address space = set of mem address space assigned to a process in the RAM



Input and Output operations.
How the OS does IO management. (any data exchange operation that happens between computing system and external env. 

Catgories of I/O Devices:
HUman Readable (users can interact with. eg. keyboards, printers, mouse)
Machine Readable (ones that comm data in a format that can be understood by the computing system without human input)
Comms Devices (enable transmission of data between computing systems or between computing systems and larger networks)


Differences in I/O Devices:
Data Rate 
Application (or Use Case)
Unit of Transfer (bytes or characters, larger blocks like disks) (keyboard/mouse are character oriented devices, disks are characterized as block oriented devices)
Error Conditions (how the conditions are handles or responded to)



Organization of the I/O Functions:

Programmed I/O:
  The process will send a request for I/O, usually for resource constrained or low speed devices

Interrupt Driven I/O:
  Similar to programmed I/O, but the CPU won't remain in a status checking cycle. The CPU will perform another task, once interrupt is sent then I/O operation happens. 

Direct Memory Access (DMA)
  The DMA module controls exchange of data between main mem and I/O device




DMA:
Feature of the systems to directly allow the subsystem to access the RAM independently of the CPU 
Overall objective of DMA is to bypass CPU for IP operation.

When a process issues r/w command:
  it issues DMA command
  whether r or w 
  address of I/O device involved
  Starting location of memory to r or w from
  The no of words to be r or w 

With all that done, the DMA command is setup, CPU will do some other task, and the DMA will do it's thing and bypass the CPU, and then send an interrupt to the CPU once it's finished.

The DMA logic can be either built into the I/O device, or the DMA might control multiple I/O devices. 


Operating System Design Issues:
Can use multiprogramming to have a set of ready processes to keep CPU busy for some time. (not 100% use, but maybe 60-70% for embedded systems)
The objective is always to make the I/O device should be easily accessible to all processes. (generality)


Types of I/O Devices:

Block Oriented:
  Info stored in fixed sized blocks (used for disks)

Stream Oriented:
  Resp for data exchange in units of bytes or characters (keyboards, mouse etc)



IO Buffering:
Temp store data in buffer (sysMem) that passes between prcocessor and a peripheral (usually to smooth out difference in rates of data exchange)

Why buffering?
  To deal with speed mismatch between producer and consumer of data
  Certain pages must remain in MainMem during I/O (during the I/O request) 


Synchronous vs Asynchronous I/O operations:

Synchronous I/O
  When a process has requested for an I/O op, the thread has to wait until the I/O operation is complete.
Asynchronous I/O
  Process will not wait for the I/O op to complete. So the thread can continue with other work while it waits for I/O (eg. if subsequent process doesn't depend on the previous process' I/O data)


Buffering Schemes:          (buffer = portion of MainMem)

  Single Buffer:            (figure 11.6)
    Simplest Type
    One buffer assigned to particular process
