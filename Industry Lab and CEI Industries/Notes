Cases come in waves (eg. corona, fraud sms 
eg. PS4 game 
shows spam messsages
Social mdeia hacks - guessing the passwords, based on posts history
Get emails from somewhere, send password reset request to websites

We have to come up with ideas, the ideas they show are the ones they've done before. We gotta come up with stuff that can help the org

GATE biometrics, new project htye're working on

How it started:
started small, tests to see if it work
Started with 8 cameras, and then added more. 


trying to collect more data to train algo 

everytime they reach 200 people trained, they try and improve the algo some more 

at the current stage, the current challenges are to compare with biometric tunnel (series of cameras around the subject)

There's a lot of data going in, lots to sift through

AI Prezi

Lacking of high quality training data
Limited access and afford.
Data privacy and security concern (sometimes data not allowed to leave region)
complexity and implementation 
Ineff data structure


It's important to know where to start


Oracle provides context infrastructure (?)

NXUS Data Engine (prepare AI)
NBULA AI/ML Platform (build AI, low/nocode so everyone can use 

the company works closely with UAE Financlia hub
