Pen testing methodology, pretty exciting topic 


In UAE, you need to do the pen testing twice and then submit a report 

Pen testing Exec Standard (PTES)
  - Global standard
  - To make sure the tests are done in the proper way
  - released BlackHat in 2011
  - Open license 
  - TO ENABLE BUSINESS TO SET A BASELINE FOR PEN TESTING STANDARDS AND GUIDELINE


PTES Methodologies:

  - 7 Major steps:
    - Pre-engagement (define scope)
      - what we are testing
      - time estimation
      - deadlines etc.
      - Scope meeting (With client), Scope creep(subtle deviation from original scope)
        - A simple questionnaire can help with defining the scope 
        - eg. how many websites, what networks can be tested, no of apps
        - usually specifies the IP ranges (helps the pen tester)
      - Communication (emergency contact list)
      - Client Incident Response team test kept in the dark as well
      - Challenges: Scope Creep, Legal compliance, 
    - Intel Gathering
      - To collect as much info as possible about the target
      - Helps the tester to identify all attack vectors and surfaces 
      - OSINT 
        - Passive (info on third party sites like insta etc), Semi-passive (search engine data, internet traffic, internal traffic and behavior, ONLY public available reources), Active (direct interaction, like scanning oper ports) info gathering
      - Ensure the domain being tested is within the scope (avoid scope creep)
      - Footprinting
        - whois lookup, RIPE, ARIN, Nominet
        - BGP looking glass
      - Active Footprinting
        - Ping sweep, port scanning, nmap, banner grabbing (getting OS info, app info etc)
        - SNMP sweeps, DNS info, SMTP Bounceback
        - Web app discovery, SQL Databases (misconfiguration of DB),  misconfigured wireless networks, 
    - Threat Modeling (how the attacker might approach)
    - Vuln Analysis
    - Exploitation 
    - Post Exploitation
    - Reporting
