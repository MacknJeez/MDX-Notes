Pen testing methodology, pretty exciting topic 


In UAE, you need to do the pen testing twice and then submit a report 

Pen testing Exec Standard (PTES)
  - Global standard
  - To make sure the tests are done in the proper way
  - released BlackHat in 2011
  - Open license 
  - TO ENABLE BUSINESS TO SET A BASELINE FOR PEN TESTING STANDARDS AND GUIDELINE


PTES Methodologies:

  - 7 Major steps:
    - Pre-engagement (define scope)
      - what we are testing
      - time estimation
      - deadlines etc.
      - Scope meeting (With client), Scope creep(subtle deviation from original scope)
        - A simple questionnaire can help with defining the scope 
        - eg. how many websites, what networks can be tested, no of apps
        - usually specifies the IP ranges (helps the pen tester)
      - Communication (emergency contact list)
      - Client Incident Response team test kept in the dark as well
      - Challenges: Scope Creep, Legal compliance

    - Intel Gathering
      - To collect as much info as possible about the target
      - Helps the tester to identify all attack vectors and surfaces 
      - OSINT 
        - Passive (info on third party sites like insta etc), Semi-passive (search engine data, internet traffic, internal traffic and behavior, ONLY public available reources), Active (direct interaction, like scanning oper ports) info gathering
      - Ensure the domain being tested is within the scope (avoid scope creep)

      - Footprinting
        - whois lookup, RIPE, ARIN, Nominet
        - BGP looking glass
      - Active Footprinting
        - Ping sweep, port scanning, nmap, banner grabbing (getting OS info, app info etc)
        - SNMP sweeps, DNS info, SMTP Bounceback
        - Web app discovery, SQL Databases (misconfiguration of DB),  misconfigured wireless networks

    - Threat Modeling (how the attacker might approach)
      - Focuses on two elements (assets and threats)
      - tester INDENTIFIES most likely threat vector
      - General model
      - Business Asset model
      - Business xxxxx model --------------------------------- check 
      - Clear Idenificaation of location aof threat (internal v external)
      - Threat capability analysis
      - Motivation modeling (motivation of threat actor/community)
      - Compromise of comparable organizations

    - Vuln Analysis
      - Start looking for vulns on the systems and apps
      - Active testing (direct interaction with components of the test (Automated or manual)
      - Passive Testing (no interaction with components, ie. metadata and traffic analysis)
      - Attack trees (formal metghods for analyzing security, root = target, leaf = ways of achieving)
      - research (public and private) (public = commercial software, public guides)
      - eg. if you find client user's username and password in a public data base? 
          My answer - make sure any more passwords aren't on the public databases. 
                      Send out communication to employees regarding changing passwords, enable 2FA, Enable password changing rule (how often you have to change the passwords)
                      make sure unused sessions aren't being used/still logged in
          Class answer - stricter password policy, access/PAM control, MFA, Data Loss Prevention system, find out which system was compromised for the data 
    - Exploitation 
    - Post Exploitation
    - Reporting
