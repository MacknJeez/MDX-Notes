Pen testing methodology, pretty exciting topic 


In UAE, you need to do the pen testing twice and then submit a report 

Pen testing Exec Standard (PTES)
  - Global standard
  - To make sure the tests are done in the proper way
  - released BlackHat in 2011
  - Open license 
  - TO ENABLE BUSINESS TO SET A BASELINE FOR PEN TESTING STANDARDS AND GUIDELINE


PTES Methodologies
  - 7 Major steps 
    - Pre-engagement (define scope)
      - what we are testing
      - time estimation
      - deadlines etc.
      - Scope meeting (With client), Scope creep(subtle deviation from original scope)
        - A simple questionnaire can help with defining the scope 
        - eg. how many websites, what networks can be tested, no of apps
        - usually specifies the IP ranges (helps the pen tester)
    - Intel Gather
    - Threat Modeling (how the attacker might approach)
    - Vuln Analysis
    - Exploitation 
    - Post Exploitation
    - Reporting
