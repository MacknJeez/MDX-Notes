Advanced Google search terms (contains, has etc)
BAsic operatiers 
Advanced operators 


Activity 1
Q. What are the primary methods used for father info during the foot printing phase of a pen test, and how can this info be utilized to tindetify potential vulnerabilities?
Search google for ways to do footprinting 


If you find systems in a company that still has outdated servers or infra, that can be a potential attack window
