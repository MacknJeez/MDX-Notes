Try to keep fortnightly meetings/sessions (every 2 weeks)

But fehmida's the goat so she won't have any meetings ofc cuz she's giga busy


Professor should have clear view of progress (show all steps)
So they can also vouch for your work 

60 credit, final course
Degree classification depends on this module heavily 

this course has to be distinction and half of my other courses has to be in distinction as well (should be in 1-4 range) 

Independent study module
  - Research/project management module
  - Specifics of project is with you and the professor/library 

Student research bootcamp in the summer (CAS, 6 weeks, starts in May) [april - september is when we'll be working on our projects)

Module gives you everything [esp marking criteria!!!!!!!]---------------------------- you can do a self assessment before submitting, to get a gauge on how much you scored


4 assessments
  - Formal proposal - 10% 10 marks
  - Milestones - 10% literature review 
  ^ those are the same for parttime and full time
  - final report 26/09/2025 ---- Part time is on 01/01/2026
  - Viva 1-15/10/2025


FCP is almost the same as the Formal proposal, she'll tell us what's different 
Focus on classes for now, then in april you can start focusing on the report 

Important resources available:
  - https://www.mdx.ac.ae/library------------------------ reading list on https://mdx.keylinks.org/new-ui/
    - have a good book to refer to so you know what to write
  - https://libguides.mdx.ac.uk/Dubai/onlinecourse ------------------------ intro to researching using library
    - Recommended course, v important apparently, designed for masters students, section c is entire march, section d is april to may 
  - https://mdx.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=24990
  - skills focus workshop https://libguides.mdx.ac.uk/library_focus


Use AI to enchance, not create 
Use AI ethically (v strict, don't be idiot)
Overall AI grade doesn't matter as much, the individual degree of copy/AI matters more (they look at each "hit")
Find where you want to get the data from, which algos to use
Make a repo of all resources that you might require 

------------------------------------------------------------- Research and Ethics ----------------------------------------------------------------------


Research Ethics is a risk assessment from the research perspective 
  - Data consent, eg. script for pen testing, make sure the env is ethical and you have consent
  - V strict policies in this uni, violating that is fail grade (they have failed people on this before, so gotta move swiftly, girls from the south get a little bit shifty
  - at the end of the research, there will be a research ethics screening form 
  - Ethics form is mandatory to submit, put in the appendix of the report -------------- make sure about this first 
  - Self assessment form must be done by everyone [CHECK THE RESERACH ETHICS PROCESS FLOWCHART, check teams)
  - If you don't require full ethical review, then you can proceed with the research

check the damn flowchart on teams!!!!!!!!!

  - If you make amendments on the project, then you have to resubmit the ethics application (the nature of the project has changed)
  - The submissions were online, now it's a pdf that you send it to the prof
    - fehmida says her students upload it on teams, then she'll verify and check and you can get it back from there itself
  

Types of forms to submit
  - Amendments request form
    - Once formal proposal is submitted and approved, then it's hard to get the topic changed (lack of resources, any other genuine reasons will be considered)
    - The objectives of the project changed -> doesn't need this form
      - Make the objectives in order; so 1 is definitely doable, 6 is a maybe, can drop later (Action verbs)
  - Research ethics screening form
    - Flowchart calls it self assessment form, don't be confused
    - For everyone to complete (submit to supervisor)
    - Goes in appendix of report
    - Even access to non-sensitive data means it's a yes to human participants 
      so you need a full research ethics form to be filled once your supervisor approves your screening form
    - Testing is also data collection
  - Research ethics form
    - Final form, must be submitted if required
    - Determined if required by your assigned professor

  
  Both forms are supposed to be in the appendix (both if required, which I need, only the first one if all your answers for the screening form is NO)

  If you have to get data from an org, the Gatekeeper letter is a template for the college's approval saying that I am actually a student
  Exploratory research is when you question professionals regarding the topic (?)


More Slides on the same thing:
   -What is a project proposal?
    - It's a roadmap for the research for itself, so if your proposal is detailed and well though out, then the research will also be good
    - Usually follow the FCP and Formal proposal template to get it right
    - Formal proposal is when you have a basic understanding of the project itself (literature review)
    - First Cut Proposal doesn't have a Gantt Chart, Include ethics screening as part of the document when you submit it
