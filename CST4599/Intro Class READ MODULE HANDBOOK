ACADEMIC INTEGRITY (how much chatgpt can I use)

Q.If I learn about a topic using gpt, how do I reference that?
FIND THE ORIGINAL INFO AND REFERENCE THAT

eg. https://consensus.app, https://www.researchrabbit.ai 




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lookup a recent journal or paper, see what they mention that is a limitation or shortcoming of the paper or research topic (research gap)
