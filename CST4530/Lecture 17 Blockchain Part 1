What is blockchain?
  - part of distributed ledger technology
  - wasn't initially made for currency
  - Used by DHA (covid vacc records), Cross-border payments (no real money, every bank has account in the place you send money from)
  - SWIFT network, controlled by the US, when the US nerds want to punish, they stop the country from using it
  - Trying to do immutability (if one person tries to change the transaction, the rest of the people on the blockchain can kick the person out of the blockchain)
  - Immutable, transparent and not linked to personal info (userID is actually just walletID)

HASH is v important in this 

I am a peer, my laptop is a node

SenderID, ReceiverID, Sender WalletID, RexieverID is all plaintext

Monero encrypts the RecieverID, SenderID but walletID is plaintext (confirm pls)

First block on the blockchain is called genesis block (no hash, makes hash for the next block)

If anyone tampers with any block, the neighbouring blocks will have the appropriate hashIDs to make sure that the block wasn't tampered with 

Public blockchain - data is not encrypted (as a concept, can be implemented differently like Monero)
Private blockchain - data is encrypted

Encryption/Decryption still uses RSA2048 (with some exceptions)
Needs to be asymmetric key 
eg. Bitcoin can use RSA256,2048,5012 (min recommended is 2048, but can still use)

take note of Partior, Tessera (research)

P2P Peer or Point?
In blockchain, it's Peer2Peer, but he said some weird shit you gotta double check that 

Binance has nodes on the blockchain, we are just the user who uses the wallet stored on binance servers
When we own our wallet and we host it, then we become a node on the blockchain 


What are some issues? (not cyber)
  - no central control to protect the full system (cuz it's P2P) (if some Peers have weak protection, then the entire network can be affected because it's compromised the ability to confirm and make a consensus)
  - Started as a hobby project, to get around the centralized payment methods, unknown starter
  - No Intermediate standard layer (Eth can't talk to BTC)
  - Built on Democracy (if majority says, then it's true). If majority of the nodes go rogue, then you can take control of the transactions (china, on BTC) 51% attack 
  - How does the network decide which node can add a block to the chain
    - Every node(everyone has control, democracy), selection of nodes (SWIFT network, few people have control) or one node can (single authority is easiest)
  - More money in circulation, then there's more to spend and there's more money ..... so there's usually a hard limit on how many of the monies exists



Proof of Work (PoW)
  - Double-spending attack (spend what you don't have, can't verify the amount of money the ownder has)
  - When you compute (verifying the hashes are right when a new block is added to a block-chain, the reward given for the compute power used)
  - Hardwork to make sure the crypto is legitamate 
  - the Crypto is the digital asset of the blockchain, the reward is the same currency as the work the compute is done on 
  - The required power is exponential, the more the blocks the exponentially harder it is to calculate and verify the hashs
  - It's gotten so huge that one node can't do it by itself anymore, so it's done in pools
  - Not good for environment, needs a lot of electricity and generates heat (alternates created, Proof of Stake, Proof of Storage)


Proof of Stake (PoS)
  - Instead of work done, you put your own money as collateral (but the workload is reduced as well)
  - Delegated Proof of Stake

There's more Proof of's, check internet 



Blockchain layer:
  - Consensus Layer is the most important (about who or which wallet has what balance)
  - Mining Layer (make sure when new blocks are added, that there ar epoeple who can verify it) (like a bookkeeper, also keeps track of attempts to change or tamper)
  - Propogation layer (block creation, deletion, propogation, node communication etc) (how the info is prop'd, how the broadcast works. implementation of broadcast differs between each node and stuff)
  - Semantic Layer (like in TCP/IP, there's headers about dest source etc, this is like that but for blocks and stuff)(flooding is a positive thing, the information needs to travel across large number of nodes)
  - Application layer (where the smart contracts are, web3, smart mobile apps)(the application that DHA built to keep track of the covid vaccs, is on this layer)
