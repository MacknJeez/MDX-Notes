Config is easy, movement is easy. Harder to manage with DataCenters.

What's the first thing that happens when a DC goes down? UPS turns on
Keeps it on for 2-3 days (90ish days)
Then after that it's generators (or whatever the next powersource is)

NEVER TAKE POWER FROM ONE SUBSTATION ONLY

Three Main Threats
Env 
Human
Technical

Ideal to put DC on 1st/2nd floor 
Don't build DC in earthquake prone areas
Don't build near volcanoes?

Never have your power and data cables close together, causes packetloss etc.
any interference interrupts the flow of electrical currentsl

FM-200 (heptaflouropropane) or Mist (HI-FOG)


Russia Ukraine War -> EMP attacks (on DCs?)

Special types of cables used in Plenums, that don't let off hazardous gases when burning (because plenums are where most fires happen in these kinds of spaces)

Protect distro panels, transformer cables that have access controls
Do not run power lights directly over fluorescent lights (noise emitted from these kinds of lights)
Use ManTraps (revolving cubicle thingies, think of airport smart gates, don't let more than one person inside)
Power should cut off automatically when water is detected (pls replace the damn sensors before DC inspections)

A lot of ManTraps have thermal cameras (works at night as well)

Example of unmanned DCs is weather data processing, acts like a CDN -> faster data delivery to you even though it's unmanned

In the 70s, the DOD of USA, orange books existed 
Security specific book. has a bunch of security terms and methods. Only used when super needed, very outdated and also just old

Bell - LaPudula Model [NO READ UP, NO WRITE DOWN]
If you're at security level A, you can't read higher security clearance documents
If you're at security level Z, you can't write lower security clearance documents

Operating system is a Reference monitor, can enforce BLP model 
In VMs, Kernels, Hypervisors (layer that controls how to protect the kernel)
