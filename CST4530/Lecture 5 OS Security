Let's say you are a sec architect and you need to give a recomm for installing a new OS and securing:
Install the OS 
Apply Security patches (can automate, connect to patching server)
Benchmarks (CIS) (implements security defaults) 
  usually L1 is good enough
  L2, application might break 

He shows us Services.msc and tells us to check what every service does 
Feature Rich (you might not need it, but it starts on startup so it's harder to secure)
"Does my org need this service?" If no, then service should be off 

How do you decide which service is good or bad?
Using the CIS Benchmarks (he opens CIS Ubuntu Linux benchmark pdf)
You only need one, it's a great help to have 


Basic OS Hardening:
"I'm installing an Win11 Ent OS on my org system, give me top 5 steps."
Only install/enable what you require (keep it minimal)
  he gives example of enabling Internet Information Services in Windows Features (Reference monitor checks if it's on, and who can make changes to this setting)
Disable unnesscesary services 
CHange Default Passwds
Configure Privileges (windows via group policies in activedirectory, linux there's scripts)



Linux Security Model:                                    note: .sh is basically an .exe (it's a shell script)
Root can do anything
If attacker gains root, defense gets a notif 
If you get root access, you get complete access to the system 

Linux DAC Model (Discretionary Access Control):
Subject is user 
Object is file
kernel assigns object permissions 
eg. user, group, other 


File Permissions on UNIX:
There's two ways to depict permissions on UNIX (letters and numbers)
r - 4
w - 2 
x - 1
So 7 means all r,w,x
6 means r,w 

eg -rw-rw-r-- maestro conductors 222 Apr 1 02:00 music.sh
    6 6 4 
  maestro (owner) can read
  conductors (group) can read
  other can read
In decimal notation, what's the worst perms you can give, 7 7 7
best/most secure? it depends... 6 0 0 (princple of least privilege, only give access to those who need it)


CHMOD:
chmod 0764 filename 
chmod u+wrx, g+rw, o+r filename (don't use this one, it's confusing for no reason, chdmodcommand.com)
