Feature Rich (you might not need it, but it starts on startup so it's harder to secure)
"Does my org need this service?" If no, then service should be off 

How do you decide which service is good or bad?
Using the CIS Benchmarks (he opens CIS Ubuntu Linux benchmark pdf)
You only need one, it's a great help to have 


Basic OS Hardening:
"I'm installing an Win11 Ent OS on my org system, give me top 5 steps."

Disable unnesscesary services 
CHange Default Passwds
Configure Privileges (windows via group policies in activedirectory, linux there's scripts)
