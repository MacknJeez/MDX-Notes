When coins are in unlim supply, the supply is controlled by "burning" (putting in unusuable account) to limit the supply and increase the value 

To keep a coin limited, the number of blocks must also be limited (how often the block can be limited, thus limiting the no. of transactions) 
  - This is why there are fees/gas, give extra moneis to skip the line and transactionize your thing (premium/fees/gas)
  - This became a problem after 2014, cuz many people joined and starteding 
    - this is where sidechains (multilevel blockchain) came up, every determined amount of transactions done for the sidecoin, it is then summarized and made into one transaction for the larger coin that the sidecoin is based on 
      (TRON relying on ETH)
    - Benefits of larger coins, with the speed of the smaller coins' transactions

Chain forking - Forking the codebase so that everyone using it can have their own required version of the coin without losing value but the coin's code is updated

Spotify uses Blockchain to host music
  - Some creators want per million itna paisa do, but some users want per play (which needs a lot of trust between record company and creator) so blockchain is used to keep track 

Pump and Dumps
  - it's so easy to make your own chain, give free coins

  - 2017, cryptokitty (hellokitty crypto) millions of dollars earned by nerds playing 


In traditional finance systems, there's a trusted third party thing
  - you go to trusted third party (usually bank), give them money as escrow, if seller has genuine goods then the bank pays them and gives you the goods
    - Usually banks take a cut to do this 
  - Fraud and Money Laundering
    - banks can't collude with other banks 

New Financial System
  - No third party, self governed
    - Using minors etc.
