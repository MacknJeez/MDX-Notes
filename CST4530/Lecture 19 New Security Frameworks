Firesmith Framework
  - never fully implemented
  - new tech needed (eg. blockchain)


Early Internet
  - ARPANET (1969)
  - TCP/IP was chosen quickly
  - telnet,email,FTP came after
  - John Postel managed IP alloc (IANA)



Perimeter Defence (can be bad internal defence but godly outer defence)
  - Firewalls (packet, circuit-proxy, stateful, app-proxy)
  - Weaker than having defence at every step (Digital Security By Design)
  - DDoS can still smack it's ass
  - Y-Comm is better (has DSBD)

NAT
  - Reduces attack surface of local network (machines that need global address have them)
  - Servers aren't communicating with real end client (only with NAT firewall translator thingy)
  - Slows down checksum calc (IPV4 header is changed by NATing)
