Firesmith Framework:
- Access Control
- Attack/Harm Detection
- Non-Repudiation
- Integrity
- Security Auditing
- Physical Protection
- Privacy and Confidentiality
- Recovery 
- Prosecution


Firesmith Framework
  - never fully implemented
  - new tech needed (eg. blockchain)

Perimeter Defence Framework (can be bad internal defence but godly outer defence)
  - Firewalls (packet, circuit-proxy, stateful, app-proxy)
  - Weaker than having defence at every step (Digital Security By Design)
  - DDoS can still smack it's ass
  - Y-Comm is better (has DSBD)

Y-Comm Framework (the framework looks like a Y, Communication)
  - Improvement over Perimeter Defence
  - Deals with heterogenous networks (4G, 5G, Wifi, Ethernet etc)
  - SAS (Security and Applicatin Security) ----------------------------- Used more often 
    - for applications and deploying services
    - AAACs, ACLs, User-based security
  - QoSS (Quality of Service Security) (aka QBS)
    - look at QoS issues
    - SLAs, DOS and DDOS attack security 
  - NTS (Network Transport Security) ------------------------------------ Used more often 
    - deals with E2E transport of data in Y-Comm
    - Layer 5 (APSTNDP) so that's network layer
    - NAT, IPSec, VPNs
  - NAS (Network Architecture Security)
    - concerned with deployment of architecture 
    - encryption algos
    - enforce sec and QoS at device level

Early Internet
  - ARPANET (1969)
  - TCP/IP was chosen quickly
  - telnet,email,FTP came after
  - John Postel managed IP alloc (IANA)

NAT
  - Reduces attack surface of local network (machines that need global address have them)
  - Servers aren't communicating with real end client (only with NAT firewall translator thingy)
  - Slows down checksum calc (IPV4 header is changed by NATing)


Targeted Security Models
  - How the system is being used
  - infra can perform safely and securly
  - Three types:
    - Connection TSM
      - Server is started 
      - QBSserver to QBScore for SLAs etc
      - Mobile node is started, NASmobile contacts NAScore 
      - QBSmobile  checks with QBScore for wireless infra access
      - NTSmobile contacts NTScore for connection to server
      - NTScore to NTSserver to say call is coming, checks security detail of client and of connection
    - Ring-based TSM (think of scopes as rings, 00 on the innermost, 11 on the outermost)
      - Usually for servers
      - Services classified using scope
        - Local machine (file systems) 00
        - Local Network services       01
        - Domain Services              10
        - Global Services              11
      - Scope of server must be decided when started
    - Vertical Handover TSM
      - Mobile networks
      - In some mobile networks, handover is controlled by client
        - client can abuse by asking for more resources than needed
      - Steps for Vertical handover TSM
        - QBS of mobile network cotacts QSB of potential target
        - Request passed to QBScore
        - QoS brokers of all networks probed by core (MN has idea of QoS after this)
        - NASmn starts ReAuth proc
        - through NAS, AAA server forwards ReAuth 
        - CentralAuth passes info to target network and do AAA(authen,author,account) functions
