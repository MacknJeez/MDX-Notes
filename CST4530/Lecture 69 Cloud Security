Horizon - OPENSTACK and OpenNebula (open source cloud stuff, like azure aws but self hosted ie. private clouds)

KVM, VMWARE is not cloud, but it's orchestration platform to manage and build cloud


Physical hardware is baremetal, where the cloud orchestration tools are installed

VirtualMachines are the old way of doing things. VMWARE is the hypervisor that can create the virtual machines on the hardware itself. Which usually has it's own OS (host OS).
A lot is wasted in running hostOS and then the virtualOS. So containers were designed, to run lightweight systems. 

Pay-as-you-go model, pay for what you use, not what you reserve.

DigitalOcean is a paid software, that won't let you install it on your systems but make you use their hardrware. 

In any IaaS, physical security is not concern of customer.
But to make sure that the hardware is up and running is upto cloud provider. We don't care how microsoft does it. 


PaaS (shopify is a paas, you gotta work on it by designing and modify. even wordpress is another paas)
