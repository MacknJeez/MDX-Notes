CIPHER SUITES

CBC/GCM/EC/OFB/PCBC/CTR/CFB basically different ways of adding randomness to encrypytion algos in data transcriptions.
Adding long string (IV) before encryption 
ECB not safe now NEVER ALLOWED 

ECDH elliptical curve diffie hellman's algo
elliptical curve crypto, very hard to predict so it's very good method 

Uses AES, aka Rjindael

the higher the "rounds" the higher the bit keys, the better the algo performs in terms of security 


using RFC tcp handshake (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#page-6)

Certificates are how browsers know to trust you online
  attackers can compromise the root auth certificates to direct you to malicious websites 

Study TLS handshake well, it seems quite interesting actually
