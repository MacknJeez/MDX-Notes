Zero Trust Networks
  - Better than perimeter defence
  - needs more compute, network infra
  - Network is assumed hostile
  - External/Internal threats exist all the time
  - Network locality is not enough trust
  - Everything is authenticated and authorized
  - Dynamic Policies
  - Control Plane
    - direct and control data flow
    - like Software-defined networking

Threat Models
  - Oppurtunistic
  - Targeted 
  - Insider
  - Trusted Insider
  - State-level

How to identify Endpoints as secure
  - strong authent
  - PKI
  - Digital Certs
  - Least privilege 

A better way:
  - network agents
    - combine user, device apps and activities into one category
    - give the network agent a trust score
      - agent, user trust scores
      - user role, group, residence, authen method
      - Device trust score, manufacturer, current location 
      - TPM manufacturuer, version
    - combine with policy to generate authorization for interaction

Authorization Architecture
  - enforcement    (data plane)
    - handles new requests, enforces requests
  - policy engine  (control plane)
    - decides whether to accept request
    - based on network services, endpoint access and user roles
  - trust engine   (control plane)
    - risk analysis of request (numeric value)
  - data stores    (control plane)
    - data stores (inventory, AAA database etc)
