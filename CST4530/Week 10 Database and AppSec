Types of Databases:
RDBMS (stored in a form of a table, structured data stored in structure)
  SQL, Oracle, MySQL, Dynamo, Aurora, PostgreSQL 
Non-RDBMS (any random data, eg. email, not stored in tables)
  NoSQL
REDIS (database stored in RAM)
KeyValue Pair (KVPair, faster data retrieval)


CRUD (create, read, Update, Delete)

ACID principle (atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
  A -  Finish an entire operation, or roll back to previous state
  C - if a data value is supposed to be int, but changes in transit then it loses the integrity
  I - Common sense
  D - Once you commit, it should be 100% sure that it's commited

PowerBI has curated data (analyzed, summarized etc.)


Negative Number Attack: 
  try to transfer -10 dirhams to a friend, it should not accept it. 

Blind SQLi (read in between the lines of the error messages)
  Interpret the error message to tell what the DB is doing with the queries (can tell you the command being run in the background to run your query)



SQL Injection 
Give me a coffee, but also the money in the register (asking the DB for something, along with some other data that you're not authorized to access)
