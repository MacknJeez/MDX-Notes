Harsh class



In the companies that only let sec team detect changes or risks:
CISO reports to CIO 
Local CISO (uae)
Field CISO (middleeast)
Global CISO (my ass)


Types of teams in cybersec:
Red Team, Blue Team,
GRC (paperwork team) (doesn't actually find the risks or vulns, they just deal with the consequences or repercussions)
Regulations team (converts the regulatory requirements into technical requirements), 
security architecture

These are all guidelines, how the company implements can be different. It can also be a differnet company entirely for each team

BLUE TEAM
First you gotta defend:
  - SOC Analyst (creates alerts)
  - Threat Intel
  - Forensics (malware analysis)
  - Incident Response (same as Forensics usually)
  - Analysts (looks at alerts)
  - Brand Monitoring (if mdx website is something, new website called something-academy)
  - Access management 
One team makes changes, security teams detect/review/verify change (segregation of duties)



RED TEAM
Credential/Password/Identity managemne 
Password Chubbing (?) ---- apparently cutting off access after production or deployment 
CyberArc, ConnectWise, Delinea

Pentesting
Reverse-engineering of bin files
Appsec testing
Social engineering
In DevOps lifecycle, Build stage is where the red team first interacts with the product (Pre-Go Live)
Identify the risks, if accept then send to GRC 
If mitigate, then part of Security Architect role
Identify risks after product goes live (Post-Go Live)
Red Team also simulates real world attacks (blackbox testing)
Assume-Breach testing


PURPLE TEAM 
Consultancy/Design
Not the ones who do pentest by themselves, won't monitor SIEM solutions the whole day
Identify risks 
Security architects are part of this
Whitebox testing



EXTRA ROLES (recent)
Security can't all be manual (different tools to be secure)

Security Platform Owners
Change Management (Change release team, and other aliases)




In the companies that also let the Sec team make changes as well:

Security also does end-point, network security etc
