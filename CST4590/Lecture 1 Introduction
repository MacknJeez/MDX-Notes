Handbook will be uploaded after approval from hendon campus

Module is good for people who want to do cyber governance (eg ISO 270001)

Or if you want to go into sec awarenness

No tests, no presentations

---------------------LECTURE----------------------------


Entire course revolves around NIST framework:
  Identify 
  Protect 
  Detect 
  Response 
  Recovery

Forencesics comes in R and R, sometimes in Detect also

CSIRP/Playbook, in the playbook it must be specified the detection measures and prevention measures

190-200 days to detect an incident, which is reducing with each time it's fixed and shared.


How to prepare against threats that have infinite time and money?
- At technical level (eg. SOAR programs)
- At non technical level (governance, organizational level)

NOT ALL DATA IS WORTH THE SAME!!!

If in asset list you find print server and database, database is more valuable 


The perfectly secure system doesn't exist, umless disconnected and covered in concrete and buried in the ground

Assurance is level of confidence that you provide to customers that the system and data is secure. Can be expensive, needs money to ensure controls are in place. 
Audits are there to make sure you spend the money on the right things.

You cannot secure 100% of assets. Prioritize the right assets. 

"Always prioritize the public facing assets first." It's exposed to the world.
Second priority is 3rd party exposed apps (eg APIs, ENBD to VISA/Mastercard etc)

Users and Business processes are often the greatest weaknesses. 


Estonia (among others) is a good place to host server of malware because they don't ask too many questions (weak cyber laws)

Cyberespionage, common in pharmaceutical companies (steal formulae), aircraft design compamies (to find weaknesses)

Controls shouldn't be more expensive than the risk/cost of data breach or loss 

Most important is to test control/counter measure (CAPTCHA v2, is annoying to customer so it's a poor control in terms of customer satisfaction but is safe)


CAPTCHA v3 (prob value to 0-1, anything user does might be considered robot if prob set too high)

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE 
  do not design a sec control that harms business (should be secure but not too annoying)


ORGANIZATION ROLES
  Executive
  Operational
  Technical 
  Government 
  Law Enforcement
  Intelligence Agencies


Signal Intelligence (Sig-Int) captures 1s and 0s, whether between human or computers (TEMPEST, monitors leaking energy which can be captured and decyphered. Used faraday cages to surpress this)

CIA TRIAD
Keep it confidential - Encryption
See if it's changed - Hashing
Make sure it's available - Anti DDOS, redundancy servers
