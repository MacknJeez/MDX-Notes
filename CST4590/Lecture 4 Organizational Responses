Next Week monday exam, can use the website he gave last class


ImmersiveLabs - can practice organizational response to threats 

SIEM example Splunk (sec info event management tool)
  uses weird operators, should know how to use splunk to get logs 

Incident Response tool example Velociraptor





How does an Org best respond to cyber threats?
  - Cyber Sec Plan (CSP)
  - Who does what
  - Who to approach, what funding is needed
  - Assurances, Accreditaion (confidence that it does work, verify that it works)


Legal, CISO, SOC Head, Comms team sit together to frame public replies/response to CVEs etc.
eg. Microsoft on Azure outage (try to calm users down)


Constraints on how orgs respond:
Governance (CEO and board must prioritize security)
Management (give security budget pls)
Integration (security baked in, not bolt on)


Organization Context: (Where to spend money)
Budget (countermeasures are constrained by budget) (spend money on fixing the riskiest, 4 ways of responding to risk)
  - Tolerate, Terminate, Treat, Transfer
Risk 
Collective Security (orgs get priviliges like fast internet, MPLS links)
Legal (every country has its own laws, strict regulations like GDPR, PCI DSS)
Social (control social interaction by employees, keep within limits of common sense)
Military (usually when you go to war, there's 2 armies that fight each other. In cyber, there's no prior warning)
Policy
  - policy vs guideline vs standard vs procedure 
  - not required to follow guidelines
  - must follow standard
  - policy states key areas that should be covered by the company (high level)

Types of Policies
  - Organizational
  - Issue-specific
  - Entity-specific

CSP - Policy
