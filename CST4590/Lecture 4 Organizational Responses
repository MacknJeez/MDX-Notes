Next Week monday exam, can use the website he gave last class


ImmersiveLabs - can practice organizational response to threats 

SIEM example Splunk (sec info event management tool)
  uses weird operators, should know how to use splunk to get logs 

Incident Response tool example Velociraptor



How does an Org best respond to cyber threats?
  - Cyber Sec Plan (CSP)
  - Who does what
  - Who to approach, what funding is needed
  - Assurances, Accreditaion (confidence that it does work, verify that it works)


Legal, CISO, SOC Head, Comms team sit together to frame public replies/response to CVEs etc.
eg. Microsoft on Azure outage (try to calm users down)


Constraints on how orgs respond:
Governance (CEO and board must prioritize security)
Management (give security budget pls)
Integration (security baked in, not bolt on)


Organization Context: (Where to spend money)
Budget (countermeasures are constrained by budget) (spend money on fixing the riskiest, 4 ways of responding to risk)
  - Tolerate, Terminate, Treat, Transfer
Risk 
Collective Security (orgs get priviliges like fast internet, MPLS links)
Legal (every country has its own laws, strict regulations like GDPR, PCI DSS)
Social (control social interaction by employees, keep within limits of common sense)
Military (usually when you go to war, there's 2 armies that fight each other. In cyber, there's no prior warning)
Policy
  - policy vs guideline vs standard vs procedure 
  - not required to follow guidelines
  - MUST follow standard (RFC for language, diff between must, should and may) [Cannot ignore, must follow]
  - policy states key areas that should be covered by the company (high level)

Types of Policies
  - Organizational
  - Issue-specific
  - Entity-specific

CSP - Policy 
Policies are implemented using:
  - Standards (what)
  - Procedures (how)
  - Guidelines (can/cannot, boundaries, you may try this or that. flexible, within the limits)


For every policy, CIA is the final goal 
Every policy must contain a Scope (who, when, where, what's it about)



What can a policy have?
(BYOD eg.)
Must install certain software (standard)
Must not take it outside (standard)
avoid connecting to public wifi (guideline)
You should not have any expectation of privacy (damn okay)
"Any data you create on this device belongs on the uni/workplace"


he shits on Akhilesh for talking in class, asks for masking tape 



Acceptable Use Policy (Sample) from michigan.gov
Information systems encompasses all physical and digital 
In Defense-level AUP, even elevator conversation and gossip is considered 

Autolock for screen - 5 to 10 mins
Remove system login details/session should last - 15 minutes (if it's lower, then it's bad UX)

There's a map INSIDE FORTNITE MADE BY ENBD what the fuck XD



Entity Specific Policy
  - Almost all policies address CIA
  - HR is v imp when it comes to Insider Fraud cases


CSP - Planning ------------ VIMP 
  - Must include sec in planning/deployment process (CI/CD)
  - Business unit/client creates the Requirements (check SDLC)
  - SDLC slightly different from Agile SDLC
  - At every step, sec is added (SSDLC) 
    - eg your company buys banking soft, how to make sure that it adheres to the security requirements? Before aquiring, give them questionnaire on security and let the software company answer. do demo based on the questionnaire 
    - Influence the procurement (tell them not to buy it)
  - Decommissioning
    - 7 rounds of writing 0s on the HDD to make sure you can't read the data even if deleted
    - Degaussing (removes the bits) and then the crusher
