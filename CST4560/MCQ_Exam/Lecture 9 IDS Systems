  - can be configured to have active response 
  -  

IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
  - proactive

Detection techniques
  - Patterns of network traffic, time of activity, IP address range 

Types of IDS/IPS systems
  - How to deploy it
    - Network
    - Host

    - Signature
    - Policy
    - Anomaly
