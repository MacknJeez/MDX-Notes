Secure Channels
IPSecurity


Security parameter index - configuration data added onto datagrams, has things like encryption type, ACLs etc
                            to tell the receipient how to handle the data 

Secure Channel 
  - Guarantee CIA while data transfer over insecure networks 
  - Usually has:
    - Origin Auth
    - Integrity
    - Confidentiality
  - Usually Doesn't have:
    - Non-repudiation
    - Security once data is recieved (have to rely on other security methods once data is received)

IPSec 
  - Transport and Tunnel modes
    - Transport is for IPSec aware hosts, Tunnel is for IPSec unaware hosts 
    - Transport is for H-H or H-Gate, usually within same network
    - Tunnel is for G-G, or H-G across different sites, has unsecure network in between 
      - Transport is securing the data while transporting using algos and encryption (vuln to sniffers)
      - Tunnel is hiding the data within some more data to keep it secure (within another datagram)
  - Auth and Integrity but no Confidentiality(AuthHeader protocol, 51) (uses authentication algo to make sure it's legit)
  - Confidentiality (ESP) (uses encryption to make sure data is not changed)
  - Policy and Sec Associations
  - Key Management (IKE)
  - Framework for secure comms over IP (every protocol used in IP)



AH (Authentication Header)
  - Payload length, Security Parameter Index, SeqNo, Auth data (Message Auth Code value)

ESP (Encapsulating Security Protocol)
  - Symmetric Encryption and MACs on secret keys shared
  - Provides Confidentiality or/and Authentication/Integrity 
  - Has SPI, SeqNo, MAC value added to the IP datagrams

IKE (Internet Key Exchanges)
  - Phase 1
    - negotiate SA,  with keys info
    - Specfies encryption, MAC algo, auth method, DiffHell params
    - Bidirectional 
    - Aggressive Mode
      - Gives up Identity protection, flexibility and antiDOS for faster fastness
  - Phase 2
    - Make the actual SA to be used (with AH/ESP/AH-ESP)

IPSec Security Polcies
  - How know what processing to use?
    - Security Policy Database (SPD) (list of what security polcies every datagram type should have to be considered reliable and correct)
      - On IPSec aware devices
      - made by network admins
  - Security Associations (what security features are used in this datagram, so the recepient can properly understand it)
    - Sender-Recepient relationship,  determins how packet is processed
    - Identified by SPI, Dest IP and AH/ESP, tells which SA to use
    - SAs are kept on the IPSec aware devices to see how to decrypt data for example
    - Made manually or by Internet Key Exchanges (establish connections between devices over the internet, negotiate types of algo etc)
    - Combine SAs tunnel for E2E, simple SA Tunnel for G2G data transfer
