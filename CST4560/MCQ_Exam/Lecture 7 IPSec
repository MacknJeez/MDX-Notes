Secure Channels
IPSecurity


Secure Channel 
  - Guarantee CIA while data transfer over insecure networks 
  - Usually has:
    - Origin Auth
    - Integrity
    - Confidentiality
  - Usually Doesn't have:
    - Non-repudiation
    - Security once data is recieved (have to rely on other security methods once data is received)

IPSec 
  - Transport and Tunnel modes
    - Transport is for IPSec aware hosts, Tunnel is for IPSec unaware hosts 
    - Transport is for H-H or H-Gate, usually within same network
    - Tunnel is for G-G, or H-G across different sites, has unsecure network in between 
      - Transport is securing the data while transporting using algos and encryption (vuln to sniffers)
      - Tunnel is hiding the data within some more data to keep it secure (within another datagram)
  - Auth and Integrity (AH) (uses authentication algo to make sure it's legit)
  - Confidentiality (ESP) (uses encryption to make sure data is not changed)
  - Policy and Sec Associations
  - Key Management (IKE)
  - Framework for secure comms over IP (every protocol used in IP)
