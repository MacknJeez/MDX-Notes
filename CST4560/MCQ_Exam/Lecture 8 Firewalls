Firewalls
Basic Firewalls Operations
Types of Firewalls
My ass



Not foolproof, but essential in any security protection standard
Usually between internal LAN and external networks (so DMZs etc)

If a firewall can't verify some part of a packet, then it drops the whole packet entirely
this is good because this means it's secure but can drop legitimate packets as well 

Firewalls need to be strong as hell, think of the IBOSS firewall, so it can handle all the incoming packets and filter through them.

UTM (Unified Threat Management)
  - single firewall that can do it all
  - this also means the firewall needs way more power to handle all this filtering and increased traffic flow


Types of Firewall Filtering methods (packet inspections)
  - Statefull 
    - Connection Opening -> Ongoing comms -> Connection Closing
    - Checks connection table to see if connection exists or not with the same specs as incoming traffic (white listing?)
  - Stateless

Types of Firewalls
  - Application Proxy Firewalls (APFs)
    - Dedicated firewall for application-specific traffic (like HTTPS application proxy for proxying HTTP requests out and in)
    - Usually an extra feature in Statefull Firewalls, but built in application layer monitoring for APF
    - eg. can disable HTTP POST/GET etc.
  - Packet-filtering 
    - all traffic directed to firewall, all traffic egress from  firewall
    - each application can have it's own proxy gateways (SMTP, HTTP, FTP)
    - can have application specific rules for traffic filtering 
    - Circuit level (SOCKS, proxies your IP, VPNs alter your IPs)
      - SOCKS is usually faster because it doesn't encrypt traffic, just changes where the traffic is going from
    - Static Packet Filtering (ONE PACKET AT A TIME)
    - Can block traffic based on the desc of packets in traffic (based on port numbers, IP headers etc)



NAT (Network Address Translation)
  - convert IPs to something that's already known by both sides (incoming is converted to 192.xxxx, outgoing is converted to whatever
      65.xxx etc.)
