What do you want to protect?
  Data
  Networks
  Systems
  Endpoints
  Everything in between the devices itself

The practice of protecting everything connected to networks. Because of adversaries/Attackers

eg. don't use anything that has a vuln duh
eg. don't use weak passwords
ie. have policies to prevent threats/attackers



POLICIES

Who should do what? (roles/actors/participants)
  Allow or not allow

eg. e voting, each voter make only vote once. 
eg. only admin can modify this file
eg. reciepient of email should be able to auth the sender (digital sig.)

tldr; roles, priviliges

CIA triad
Confidientiality (only peeps who are allowed to see can see)
Integrity (data should be unaltered, stable and not modified by unauth peeps) (both data in transit and stored)
  if modified, we should be able to detect the modify (hashing, hash functions)
Availability (we can access the data when needed/system should not go down)
