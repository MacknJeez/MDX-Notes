For the routing, the commands would be:

RIP:  
  network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0
OSPF: 
  - network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0                   (not subnet mask, it's the wildcard mask - 255.255.255.255-subnet mask)
  - network 192.168.10.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 
  - int g0/0/0 
    ip ospf 10 area 0
