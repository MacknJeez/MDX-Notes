Routing tables are usually built dynammically

When a path or router goes away (router dies or something), eg. in Dynamic routing algo
  The traffic doesn't immediately switch to C, it takes some time to figure out a new path to the end destination 


Dijkstra's link state algo (used in OSPF)

it's the same as UG, read something online with example 
Algo that runs on the router 

It uses the algorithm to determine the next shortest path from that router (so from u, next shortest path to anything is through x
                                                                              from x, the next shortest path is y .....)
